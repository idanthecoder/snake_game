# snake_game
Hi! This is my 10 grade project - a snake game in the Assembly language. (Note: there is one commit because I created this game way before I created my GitHub account.)

Information:
I coded this in emu8086 IDE and as such it is written in ASM x86. 
If you wish to play the game run the .exe file in DOSBOX version 0.74-3.

I would gladly accept any improvement suggestions even though the project is currently discontinued.
